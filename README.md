Due to the complexity of the implementation and the large size of the associated files, the codebase is being uploaded and updated continuously.
﻿We are updating towards a **fully "plug-and-play" version**. The final release will be a modular, drop-in replacement, allowing users to directly enable LUT-based acceleration without complex manual configuration.
﻿
The project will remain 100% Open Source and fully usable for the community. Please stay tuned for the upcoming stable release.
